# Project Overview

‚öôÔ∏è **Configurigation Initialization**: The automation process begins by reading the configuration file to set up the required automation settings.

üìß **Email Reception and Validation**: The system waits until an email with a specified subject is received. Upon reception, it downloads the attached Excel file and validates its format to ensure correct attachment data.

üîí **VPN Activation and Account Creation**:

- The "Hide Me" Desktop VPN Application is activated to access the [Hide Me website](https://hide.me/en/).
- Depending on the provided email:
    - If the email is not associated with a "Hide Me" account, an activation email is received to create a new account by inserting a username and password.
    - If the email is already linked to a "Hide Me" account, an email is received requesting a password change.
    - Upon successful account activation or password reset within 30 seconds, the robot logs out. Otherwise proceed with the next step

üîë **Login and Captcha Handling**: The robot logs into the "Hide Me" account and attempts to solve the captcha three times.

üìä **Excel Data Extraction**: Extracting User records to a user info Data table from the downloaded Excel file.

üë§ **User Profile Generation**:

- For each record in the data table:
    - Information such as name, password, birthday, address, phone, country code, company, and occupation is generated using the [Fake Name Generator](https://www.fakenamegenerator.com/).
    - Extracted data is saved in the "result.xlsx" file.
    - Valid given user data trigger account creation on the [Automation Exercise website](https://automationexercise.com/).
    - The API endpoint "https://reqres.in/api/users" is called to add user information, to get the ID retrieved from the response. To be the transition item ID

üíæ **Data Storage and Reporting**:

- Extracted data is stored in "result.xlsx", while transaction results are logged in "summary.csv", including start and end dates, user ID, username, status, error message (if any), and screenshot path.

üìß **Email Notification**: The generated "result.xlsx" and "summary.csv" files are sent via email to the recipients.

‚è≥ **Email Monitoring**: The system waits for new emails. If no emails are received within 5 minutes, the process stops.

# Core Components

## Main State Machine

![Main State Machine](https://github.com/kirollos-Magdy1/Creating-User-Accounts/assets/61789409/f7455e0a-d79e-42e7-8e65-b0d0741b18ba)

- Start by "Initialize Settings" state to load the config file
- If it is loaded successfully with no system exception, transition to the "Waiting For Email" State to receive the first email
- While a new valid email is being received, transition to the "process transaction" state
- While no system exceptions occur during the Process Transaction State, transition back to the Waiting For Email State to receive and handle subsequent emails.
